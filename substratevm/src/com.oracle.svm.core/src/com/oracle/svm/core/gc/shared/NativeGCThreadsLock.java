/**
 * Entry points that let the GC-related C++ code acquire and release the SVM {@link ThreadsLock}
 * with (unspecified-owner) read access.
 *
 * This is the SubstrateVM analog of HotSpot's {@code Threads_lock} for the GC's concurrent
 * (outside-of-safepoint) GC-state transitions: a thread that is attaching takes the
 * {@link ThreadsLock} with write access while it is added to the thread list and initialized (see
 * {@code ShenandoahBarrierSet::on_thread_attach}), so a GC thread holding read access is mutually
 * exclusive with attach/detach and cannot race the per-thread GC-state initialization of an
 * attaching thread.
 *
 * The unspecified-owner variants are used because the caller is a GC C++ thread that is not an
 * attached {@link IsolateThread} (the corresponding {@code IsolateThread} argument is null).
